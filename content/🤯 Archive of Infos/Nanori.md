- literal meaning: “to say one’s name”
- During battles, some *Samurais* who are confident with their combat prowess will go on *one-on-one fights*
- To *initiate* this, they will *introduce themselves*
- Opponents who want to *participate*, must *pay attention to this introduction*, so if ever they slay this opponent, they can claim a *bonus* by surrendering their head and *naming the accomplishments* of the slain warrior
