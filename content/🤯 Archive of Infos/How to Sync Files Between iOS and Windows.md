- Use *iCloud* to store the files in iOS
- Use *iCloud Windows* app to access these files **locally** 😉
	- Since it is accessible locally, you can easily *modify* it and it will *sync real-time* with the iOS devices 😌
	- The speed will just be *dependent* on the upload / download *speed of your internet connection* 😅
- ⚠️ I have **not tried checking** if this local storage is fully functional *without internet* 😅
