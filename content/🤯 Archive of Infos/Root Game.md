- You play as one of the *factions* that fight for *dominance* in the forest 💪
- Takes around 2-3 hours per game, but *totally worth it*
	- You won’t even feel bad for losing
- Assymetric warfare, so every faction feels very different when you play them 😉
- I personally love the *Eerie* 🦅
- Basic factions overview
	- **Marquise de Cat** 😼
		- Wants to *industrialize* the forest. Wins by building buildings ⚒️
	- **The Eerie** 🦅
		- Former rulers before the cats came, they strive to regain control through *dictatorship* 🫡👑
	- **The Woodland Alliance** 🐭
		- Rebel faction who just wants peace in the forrest through *guerilla warfare* ⚔️
		- These guys are very *annoying* to fight with 😤
	- **Vagabond** 🦝
		- **Lone warrior** who is just doing *side-quests* while everyone is at war 🌲☕🪙🎒🥾⚔️🔥⛺
		- My favorite to play as 🤣
		- Goofy events happen because of this shit 🤡
- There are *other factions* too from the expansions but that is another discussion
	- I like to play the *Keepers in Iron* 🛡️ but they are so complicated to win as
