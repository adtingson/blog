There are *two types of people in a relationship*:
- **Pints**
	- Have a huge capacity to give and to receive love / affection
	- Pints give a lot, and in exchange they also expect to receive a lot
- **Teacups**
	- Have a little capacity to give and to receive love / affection
	- Teacups give what they can

The *problem* occurs when a *Pint and a Teacup is in a relationship*
- Pints can give a lot which can be overwhelming to the Teacup
- And even if the Teacup gives their all, it can be underwhelming for the Pint

So, it is better to find someone similar to you in capacity.
