For this garden, I opted to use [[Hack]] for the headers and [[Public Sans]] for the text. The story behind this choice is quite *long* (in terms of the days I spent tinkering different fonts 😭).

I first started using the font I *grew to like*, [[Inter]]. I used this font for my Obsidian vaults where I first found it through the theme Primary by Cecilia May. I also like [[Vollkorn]], so I used it in *small-caps for the headers*. But I stumbled upon a now-dead theme for Obsidian called [The Lizzardmen Zettelkasten](https://github.com/dogwaddle/lizardmen-zettelkasten), which caught my eye for its *pen and paper -esque* vibe 😍 Ironically, I started using [[Hack]] as a font (*overall*) because I *misinterpreted the text used in the theme* as using this font. But when I realized my fault, I have already fallen in love with how my headers looked like when using [[Hack]] 🥰

The problem I have now is that [[Hack]] is *monospaced*, so it *really sucks as a body font* 😐 So I tried pairing it with serif fonts that I know because of the old design standard of [[Sans Header, Serif Body]]. I paired it first with [[Vollkorn]] because I *really like that font*, but the pairing kinda *sucked* for me 😫 So, I tried using [[Inter]] for the body although it goes against the principle of [[Sans Header, Serif Body]]. The reason I did this is because technically, [[Hack]] *isn't a sans-serif* font, and it also contains serifs 😅 So I went with [[Serif Header, Sans Body]].

The pairing of [[Hack]] and [[Inter]] looked quite *better* than the one with [[Vollkorn]], but [[Inter]]’s weakness of being *too thin and tall* kinda gets exposed when paired with [[Hack]] 😕 So, I scoured the internet for *alternatives* and after some time, I landed on [[Public Sans]] 🥳 It shares *the same issue* with [[Inter]] in terms of *thickness*, but it doesn't seem to appear tall and thin when paired with [[Hack]] 😌 So I just adjusted the *font weight* of the body from *400 to 450* to account for the thinness and *it worked well* 🥳
