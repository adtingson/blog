- **Digital Gardens** are a *collection* of ideas to continuously work on
- Preferably to learn in public
- Also helps to *seek like-minded individuals* who can help *build* on those ideas
- Reminds me of [[Zettlekasten]]
- Serves as a *second brain* in public
	- [[Atomic Notes]] found in this garden serves like the neurons
	- The links are the neural pathways!
