> [!quote] **Simon Sinek** on *Building Trust*
> *We don’t build trust by giving help*. We *build* trust *by asking* for it.

- We often *neglect* the idea of *asking for help* because we *don’t want to bother people*
- *Not asking* for help *is like denying* the other person the *opportunity to show how they care*
- It is *selfish* to not ask for help
	- You rely on your own too much — *Pride*
	- You are *implying* that the other person *does not care*
