> [!quote] **Hachiman Hikigaya** - *OreGairu*
> *I hate nice girls*. If they so much as say *hello*, it stays on my mind. If they return *texts*, my heart races. The day one calls me, I know I'll look at my call history and *grin*. But that's just them *being nice*. People who are nice to me are also nice to everyone else. I almost end up forgetting that. If the truth is cruel, *then lies must be kind*. That's why kindness is a *lie*. I gave up on always expecting it, always mistaking it, and even *hoping* for it. Someone who‚Äôs worked so hard at being alone doesn't fall for the same trick twice. I'm a *veteran* at this. I‚Äôm the best when it comes to *losing*. That's why *I'll always hate nice girls*.

I was just doom-scrolling again on Facebook when I came across this quote from *Hachiman*. And I thought to myself, ‚Äú*Damn, who hurt this man? And why do I relate so much?*‚Äù I felt bad for myself because it just felt wrong, but felt so right at the same time. So, I read the comments, and there I saw a lot of guys saying that they feel the same way. So *why is this* ü§î

I reflected upon my own experiences regarding this. The *first* thing that came to my mind was that one girl I knew years ago. She was nice, jolly, energetic, fun, and *clingy to me*. She‚Äôd listen to me talk, laugh at my jokes, and would always ask me to go with her when she needed company. Whenever she sees me *anywhere*, she‚Äôd either call me out and wave her hand at me, or she‚Äôd run at me, then grab my arm and drag me with her, or in some cases even *hug* me. She always *seemed* happy to see me, and *seemed* comfortable with my presence. And despite not showing it, I felt that way towards her.

Months past, and she kept treating me the same. It made me *confused*. I started seeing her in a *special* way. I was *in a relationship* that time, so I made things *clear* with her, because it felt so wrong for me to feel that way towards *someone else*. I *confessed* to her my confused feelings, and how she made me feel. She laughed, and told me that she thinks I am nice, and that *she was just being nice to me*. *That* cleared all my confusion about the matter. But, at the same time, it taught me something, if that was just being nice, *I don‚Äôt want it* üòê

Then, I thought about the guys who *commented* their sympathies. Have they experienced the same? Or do men just receive *very little kindness*, that a consistent show of kindness just makes us believe in something again? And for that belief to be crushed by the truth is just *cruelty*. Or do men think *lowly* of ourselves that we think we don‚Äôt *deserve* a random act of kindness? Either way, it is a *sad* reality üòî

But, if the real world has a scarcity of kindness, then maybe we should all just aim to *show* kindness. *Lie with kindness*. So that maybe one day, we don‚Äôt have to be confused *why* someone is being kind to us. So that one day, we won‚Äôt like someone *just because they were kind*. And if the **truth** is cruel, *then lie until it isn‚Äôt*.
