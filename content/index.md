Hi! Welcome to my [[Digital Garden]]. I created this originally to share my thoughts and ideas about things that I find interesting to share 😁 I started writing this on *September 07, 2024* as a *side-project during my restdays* from work, and is supposed to be *blog* as you can see in this [[Read Me]]. But things took a turn ever since *September 15* when I first uploaded my [[Atomic Notes]] notes found in the <a href="/%F0%9F%A4%AF-Archive-of-Infos/">🤯 Archive of Infos</a>. I have decided to *transform* my blog into a *Digital Garden* instead.

## Navigating

Since this is a “*Garden*,” you might find the organization of the files to be *messy*, and that is by design. Unlike structured wikis or blogs, *Digital Gardens* are designed to be navigated *via links* found in every note 🤓 So for example, if you find a link interesting while reading, you can just click on that an read about it 😊 Each note is an [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Note]] so navigating a digital garden is *like navigating the neural pathways* of your brain 🤯 And speaking of brains, Digital Gardens act like a *second brain*, that is why it is navigated that way.

As the notes build up, themes, patterns, generalizations, or groups start to form. These grouping will be called “*Maps of Content*” as they act like *anchor points for these other ideas*. So, just like your brain, *the more you build on it*, the *easier* it is *to navigate* around.

But to start, here are a few tags to start with:
- <a href="/tags/🌱seedling">🌱seedling</a> - These notes are barely just ideas. They need to grow.
- <a href="/tags/🌿budding">🌿budding</a> - These are ideas that are starting to develop into something.
- <a href="/tags/🌲evergreen">🌲evergreen</a> - This is the goal. The ideas need to be built or grown into something you can consider to be finished, completed, or concluded.

## Highlights

This is where I would place things that I like people *to read or checkout*. Mostly my *close-to-heart interests*.

- My *favorite* board game: [[Root Game|Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right ⚔️🌲]]

## Essays So Far…

Here are also some of the first <a href="/tags/🌲evergreen">🌲evergreen</a> notes I have. These were originally part of my blog 😅
