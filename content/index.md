> [!warning] I am working on weekdays, but I still write articles. I’ll upload them in batches during weekends 🙂

Hi! It seems that you have stumbled upon my personal blog. My name is **Albert**. *Most of the time*, I am either busy physically or mentally, but I do *love* a good *conversation*. I do have a very unapproachable look when I am doing something, so most people *avoid* talking to me, and when I am not doing something, I am usually thinking about something that is interesting to *me*. Most of the thoughts I have during that time, I would *really love* to share. The problem is that whenever I am not doing anything, I usually don’t have anyone to talk to anymore, *e.g.* work’s over.

With all that in mind, I have decided to start journaling *again*. But I *really* do have some thoughts that I would *love* to share, but no one to share to, so I stumbled upon some posts and articles about blogs. And *that* led me to start creating one.

If ever you’ve read one of the entries and find it *interesting* (or if you have *violent reactions*), please *feel free* to discuss it further with me. I am usually available online via *Messenger*, *Facebook*, or *Gmail*. (My contacts can also be found at the footer of every page! 😉)
