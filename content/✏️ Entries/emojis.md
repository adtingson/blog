> Do you still remember those Android emojis from 2015? Those blobs with *cute* expressions? I miss those emojis 🥺

So, I was experimenting on different ways to implement custom emojis for this blog because I *really* hate the current **Windows 11 emojis**. So I first tried to implement the Twitter emojis by using the *Twemoji* font, and I was pleased with it. It worked great, *except* in iOS devices because Apple does not like emojis other than their own 🙄

Although the *Twemojis* looked great and it worked its purpose, I am not a fan of some of its emojis. And, I also don’t find the emojis to *totally fit* my personality. So I went on scouring the internet for other alternatives that I could possibly use. I used Google Images because *visuals* 🤪 I passed across an image of the old Android emojis when they were still *lovely*, *cute*, *funny*, and *emotional* **blobs**, instead of the current circle ones. (Sooooo round 🤮)

I looked at that image of the blobs for a while and it brought *a lot* of fond memories 😍 So, I thought, “*Why not use these blobs instead?*” And I started researching for the needed resources for me to impliment them. I found a handy resource called [Blobmoji](https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji) which is a *modified* version of the old blob emojis by Google for Android (*FYI* the font Android uses for emojis is called “*Noto Color Emoji*“).

The creator of Blobmoji *also* wanted to keep on using the cute blobs of the old version of Android, instead of the current circle ones (hmmm I wonder why 🤔). So, I immediately tried using that font for the emojis and the blobs are back. But I have a *problem*, see the following image:

I *want* to have the ones from the *first row* (Android 6.0.1 version) more than the second row (Android 7 version). But Blobmoji is designed using the Android 7 version. I get the reasons for their choice, for reference here they are:
- It is more *legible*
- It is more *standardized*, minus the circle faces 🤪
- It supports *more emojis*, since new emojis get released for every newer version

**But**, I want my *squishy* blobs 😠 So, I tried to look for the font that was used for the Android 6.0.1 release. And after some time of searching multiple sites, I *finally* [found it](https://xdaforums.com/t/font-google-emoji-font-200-new-emojis-from-6-0-1.3265883/) 🥳

Now, as I mentioned earlier, this is an older version (from 2015 🤯) so it lacks *a lot* of the newer emojis, and I don’t want to go missing on my emojis 😡 So, I had an **idea**: 💡 What if I stack the emojis I want from the older version *over* the current version of Blobmoji? (It is a lot *easier* than it sounds. Source: *trust me, bro* 😉) So with that method, I get the emojis I want while I still get the missing emojis covered by the new version. And if you are *not* using an iOS device, you can see the blobs all around this site *from now on* 🥳🎉
