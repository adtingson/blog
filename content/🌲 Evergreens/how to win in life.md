How do we really win in life? 🤔 If you have lived and examined your life, you may have asked that question so *many times*, more than you’d care to count. And to me, there is *no* objective answer to this question. Whenever I think about it, I like to think about it using a mathematical principle (yup, we do maths now 😮) called [[Game Theory and War|Game Theory]].

In Game Theory, there are two types of games: A *Finite Game* – which is probably what you think of when you hear the word “game” – and an *Infinite Game*. To put it simply, a Finite Game is game where there is a *winner* and *loser*, but in an Infinite Game, the only goal is to *keep on playing*.

So, how do we identify which is which? There are a few parameters to do this:
- Do you know how many *players* there are?
- Do you know the exact *rules* of the game?
- Do you know the exact *win conditions*?

If you answered “yes” to all of those, then it is a Finite Game. If not, then it is an Infinite Game. Simple 😌 So let us examine **Life**. In Life, we don’t know the exact number of players we are playing with or against (Don’t give me that cheeky answer of, “*Just search the world’s total population*” 😠). How about the rules? There are laws, but they are local. There are Laws of Nature, but that just describes how things go. You can try to think of more, but in reality, you are *free* to do whatever if objective morality does not exist. Do we know the win conditions? *Be rich*? Then what then? *Be happy*? Can be, but how? The point is that we don’t exactly know. We were just placed in a certain environment and we do what we do. Therefore, Life is an Infinite Game, and our goal is to keep on playing (The notion of calling age as *level* doesn’t sound bad now, does it? 😈)

So, if Life is an Infinite Game, then *we don’t really win*. We “*win*” when we continue playing. We only lose when we *stop* or can’t 😐 And since we just need to continue, there are a few things that can actually help you strategize how to keep on going, but they always fall to the same thing: prioritize your *values* and have *principles*.

Let us bring the scale down and think of simpler examples. Corporations are also an Infinite Game with so many Finite Games in between (just like life 😊). Think of the Japanese Corporations, (fun fact: the oldest corporation is *Kongo Gumi* which was founded on 578 AD) they keep on playing the game by maintaining *quality* as one of their values. What do you think will happen when they give up this value? They would just fade. The same in life, pick your values, and *maintain* them. Life will be so much better. Yes, you’d be much more predictable, but that also means you are *easier* to deal with, and therefore makes it easier for others to *help* you, too. (Just imagine how you feel about the most *volatile* or swingy person you know, and I’m sure you’d know what I mean 😅)

So, we can’t really win in life. We can only make life easier. To not lose just means to keep on going. Maintain your *values* and *principles*, and what you’d need would just come naturally.
