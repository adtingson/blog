Since I have decided to create this blog, a question *popped* into my mind, ‚Äú*Why not use facebook instead?*‚Äù And it is a *valid* question really.

**Facebook** already has the *necessary* tools for longform writing. It already has my necessary *contacts*, too. All I had to do was type whatever comes into my mind and post it. So why go through the *hassle* of creating and maintaining a site? The answer ‚Äì *I just want to*! And privacy of course.

My problem with Facebook is that it is *too easy* and accessible. It encourages me to blurt out whatever comes into my mind without *filtering* it first. The only consequence I‚Äôll be facing would be the reactions and the comments that will come after these *impulsive* thoughts. And all that goes *against* my main goal in journaling, which is to improve my thoughts and therefore improve myself.

I also *enjoyed* making and maintaining the site. **Web Design** used to be a hobby of mine that became a little bit *too competitive* (different story, different time) so I‚Äôve let go of it for a while (not really, more like *half a decade*). Not only am I writing again, I am also back to *designing*. I get to develop not just my thoughts, but also my skills. It is a *win* for me.

It is just a bonus that the *only people* that would be able to see my content are the ones I have shared it to or those who knew about it. As much as I like to share my thoughts, I also like to be a *little* private about it. Another win.

With all that said, I really hope that I would *be able* to maintain it for *as long as I can*. I also hope that it would *continue* to grow as I grow.
