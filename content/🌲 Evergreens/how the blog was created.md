When I first started journaling, I started with the *analog* method of writing on a *notebook* with a pen. That was good for some time, but personally, I am someone who has a *hard time* continuing habits if they prove to be *inconvenient*, *unenjoyable*, or *uninteresting* especially if I don't see much *benefits* to my current situation. (Yup, I am one of those types that get unmotivated easily. I hope I change soon 😅)

Even though I have quit *multiple times*, I still find myself *wanting* to make journals or document my day at least. So, I kept on *trying* again and again from time to time. And ever the tinkering type, I tried to make my process *leaner*, more *efficient*, and more *convenient* for me. I went from writing *longform journals* on my notebooks, to *Bullet Journaling*, to transferring my Bullet Journal to my PC, and the process kept on until I finally have established *my own way* of Bullet Journaling using my phone.

> [!info] Quick Side Note: **Bullet Journaling**
> **Bullet Journaling**, or also known as *BuJo*, is a journaling method that uses different types of *bullet points* to organize thoughts, tasks, plans, and ideas. I’ll write something about this soon, because it is so good 🤌🤌🤌

After a *long* process of trial and error, I have *finally* created a system that I can continuously work on no matter the *excuse* I can think of. I am so lazy, but *equally* smart 😌 (I’ll write about that process at some point 😉)

Now that the habit of journaling everyday, no matter the day, *finally* stuck, I faced another challenge – I am getting *too used to it*. I wanted to challenge myself of what else I can do about my thoughts that would be both *productive* and *creative*. I also wanted to write some longform entries, but I already know from experience that I’ll either get *bored* of it, or *too busy* to actually be *interested* in it. That is when a well-timed post from Reddit came across my feed which talked about blogging or *Digital Gardens* as they refer to it in the *Obsidian Community*.

> [!info] Another Quick Side Note: **Obsidian**
> **Obsidian** is a note-taking app that functions mostly as a *Personal Knowledge Management* (PKM) tool than a productivity tool. I discovered it when I was still in college and I still use it at work, life, or in almost anything that need notes or writing.

Since the post was from the Obsidian Community, they have elaborated ways on how to convert *Obsidian notes* into these *Digital Gardens*. This was perfect for me since I can make writing more interesting because it now combines both Obsidian and a *new technical challenge*, converting these *Markdown* notes into a website! Awesome!

> [!info] Another Quick Side Note Haha: **Markdown**
> **Markdown** is a programming language that acts like a *shorthand* for *HTML*. Instead of writing *coded tags* to format text, it uses symbols, like *asterisks* and *hashtags*, so it is still *readable* in its raw form but *beautiful* its processed form.

The process of transforming my Obsidian essays to blog posts uses a tool called *Quartz*. The technical details are a lot to explain, but it is easy to use — *not too easy* to use that it is *boring* though! The default website generated by Quartz for my blog was nice, but I tweaked it *a little bit* to my own taste, which utilized my long underutilized skills in *Web Design*. So, basically, the process each blog post undergoes is:
1. I *write an essay* in Obsidian
2. I *convert the Markdowns* to webpages using Quartz
3. I *publish* these pages on my Github Page as part of my website
4. Then, I *appreciate* the *beauty* of the work I put in it afterwards 🥰

The point is not the *final product* though. The *real beauty* is in all the things I have learned along the way. From learning which journaling technique *suits me,* to learning new tools, *acquiring new knowledge and skills*, to finally *publishing a blog*, I **loved** the process. It gave me a chance to live in *my own exciting way* despite the minutiae of the adult life. And all of that gave me a new perspective, because who would have thought that a *weekend journaling project* would bring me that much *joy* and *interest*? If I was told before I started that I would need to go through all of that, I may have *not* went through it. But luckily I did, and *it was just beautiful*.
